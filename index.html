    <h2><b><u><font color="Blue">Welcome to Big Dawg Maintenance</font></u></b></h2>
<p>My name is Kevin Kaps and I am a second year student at the University of Georgia. I am home for the summer and am looking to save up some money for the upcoming school year in order to pay for books, meal-plan, and other costly necessities for the upcoming school year. I live in White Columns, in Milton and would be more than willing to help you out with any general labor you may need. I have done a lot of landscaping from mulch and pinestraw spreading to planting bushes and flowers. I have a trailer that can be used for hauling junk from your property, and have friends that would help with any heavy lifting or moving that you may need done.I will be home from June 4th to August 8th with periodic vacations throughout the summer so let me know if you need any help with anything.</p>

    <h3><b><u><font color="Blue">Why You Should Trust Me</font></u></b></h3>
<p>I have had several jobs in the past around Milton, but one in perticuler qualifies me for these sort of jobs. I worked for Steve Laboda with Capstone real estate for a couple of years doing general labor and landscaping every day on new job sites. I cut grass, moves heavy stones, pressure washed, and even assembled 100 yards of fencing all around Milton. I greatly enjoy this line of work and have almost any of the tools needed to complete the tasks you throw my way.</p>
